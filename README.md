MLA Formater code I attempted in High School and got about half way done

*I Don't think this program currently runs

This program is designed to take in a word document and format the paper so that it fits
the MLA paper format guidelines. This includes double spaced, size 12 font, Times New Roman font type.
It also requires the first line of each paragraph to be indented.

It runs in command prompt.

Steps:
1. Compile and run the program
2. copy the path to the word document into the command prompt
3. type name of the file you wish to save it as
